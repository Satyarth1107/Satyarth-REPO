      The job market may be facing a slow-down, but it's the other way round on
      the campuses of premier engineering and management colleges that are at
      various stages of the placement season. ​Engineering colleges like Indian
      Institutes of Technology and National Institutes of Technology, and
      management institutes such as Indian Institutes of Management, Indian
      School of Business, and XLRI are witnessing strong demand for fresh
      graduates and post-graduates in the current placement season, and the
      trend is likely to continue in the upcoming season as well. ​Demand for
      entry-level talent remains mostly unaffected even though lateral hiring
      remains muted, HR executives said. Most of the new recruits will be
      trained and deployed in the tech and digital transformation initiatives of
      companies where they are facing a talent crunch. ​Citigroup, Tata Steel,
      Vedanta, Deloitte Tax Consultancy Services, Schneider Electric, Philips
      and Whirlpool plan to increase campus hiring or at least keep the numbers
      steady this year, their executives said. A host of new recruiters are also
      visiting the campuses. The Punjab and Andhra Pradesh governments were
      among them at IIM-Ahmedabad, where placements for its one-year management
      programme has now ended. ​Going Strong Campus hiring by leading companies
      has not been hit ​Tata Steel, Vedanta, TCS, Whirlpool, Dabur, Schneider,
      Philips lining up to hire in higher numbers ​A host of new recruiters are
      also visiting campuses ​Citibank aiming to hire about 50% from top
      campuses this year ​Vedanta looking to hire up to 40% more B-school
      graduates ​Schneider's campus hiring numbers in 2019 likely to be 60-70%
      more than 2018 ​Most new recruits will be trained and deployed in the tech
      & digital transformation initiatives of companies ​"Initial conversations
      with recruiters tell us that they are looking at continuing or increasing
      the number of hires from campus. Many of our recruiters are revamping
      their talent pool and transforming their business models for which they
      need best talent," Amit Karna, the head of placements at IIM-Ahmedabad,
      told ET. ​Uber, Flipkart, HSBC, Oyo Hotels & Homes, Godrej and Homi-well
      were among the new recruiters at IIM-A's one-year business programme.
